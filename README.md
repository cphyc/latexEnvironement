latexEnvironment
=================

A Latex Environment to have nice and beautiful theorems and examples â€¦ even over multiple pages!

# How to use?

Put the files in your latex path or just copy them in your LaTeX
project directory. I finally managed to get working environments that
let me write *long* examples, theorems are whatever without having to
manually think about page breaks and all the stuff that is supposed to
be managed by latex.

I found http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/framed-tikz/ which
provides a nice way to circumvent the problem but is (sorry for the
author) way to fancy for any serious production. I tried to modernize
it using rounded borders but still taking some freedom
(a.k.a. fancyness) that usually doesn't come with LaTeX
packages. Enjoy and send me feedbacks and improvements.
